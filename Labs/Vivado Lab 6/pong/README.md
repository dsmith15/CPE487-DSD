# Lab 6: PONG

The first iteration of this lab included the bat and a ball that would bounce off 3 of the four walls. 
It showed how to use an input from an external source (potentiometer) to drive an action within the board. The buttons on the board
were also utilized as a start/stop for the program. The second iteration of this lab implemented changing the balls speed using the switches
and a growing/shrinking bat based on the performance of the user.
