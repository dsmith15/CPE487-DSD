# Hexadecimal Counter

The objective of this lab was to introduce Vivado and learn to program, synthesize, and implement the design and code using the Nexus A7-100T board. The code involved a hexadecimal counter that was modified to reposition the counter on display using the switches on the board. Another set of switches represented the hex bits to change the value of the counter.
